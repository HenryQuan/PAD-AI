### Projects
- [pazusoba](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazusoba), the core algorithm
- [pazulove](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazulove), machine learning
- [pazuauto](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazuauto), automation
- [pazuflata](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazuflata), pazusoba with Flutter
- [pazusoba-android](https://github.com/HenryQuan/pazusoba-android), pazusoba and automation on Android

## Max score in 10 steps
Pazusoba might be stuck in the local maxima because it cannot see in the future. With this, local maxima could be resolved most of the time and thus, improve the accuracy without performance losses. This idea was brought up by Cody senpai and it is an improvement on the algorithm.
